This program most need to minecraft hostings, that have "server advertisement".
User: "join to my server. ip: play.example.com"
But how check, that ip belongs to your hosting?
For that you can use my program.
After run the program, you can see file `domains.yml`
In that file you can configure domains, that will use in the program.
Good Luck.
